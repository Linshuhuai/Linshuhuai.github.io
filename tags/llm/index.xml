      <description>Retrieval Augmented Generation, also known as RAG, has become one of the hottest applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) currently. It involves retrieving relevant information from a domain-specific database, then merging it into a prompt template to produce responses from a LLM.
Introduction Following the surge of LLMs in early 2023, there is undoubtedly a better understanding of the capabilities of these models. However, when applying large models to practical business scenarios, it becomes evident that general-purpose baseline models cannot fully meet our specific business needs for several reasons:</description>

      <description>Inference from large autoregressive models like Transformers is slow - decoding K tokens takes K serial runs of the model. Speculative decoding is a pivotal technique to accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing a smaller draft model to predict the target modelâ€™s outputs. This article provides a brief introduction to speculative decoding and discusses early attempts in this field.
Basics Autoregressive Decoding Transformer-based LLMs typically make generations in an autoregressive manner.</description>
